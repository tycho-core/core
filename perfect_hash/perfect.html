<p><b>Perfect hashing</b> guarantees that you get no collisions at
all.  It is possible when you know exactly what set of keys you are
going to be hashing when you design your hash function.  It's popular
for hashing keywords for compilers.  (They <i>ought</i> to be popular
for <a href="#d">optimizing switch statements</a>.)  <b>Minimal
perfect hashing</b> guarantees that n keys will map to 0..n-1 with no
collisions at all.

<p>The generator is run like so, "<tt>perfect -nm &lt; samperf.txt</tt>",
 and it produces the C files <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/phash.h">phash.h</a> and 
<a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/phash.c">phash.c</a>.  The sanity test program, which
uses the generated hash to hash all the original keys, is run like so,
"<tt>foo -nm &lt; samperf.txt</tt>".

<a name="usage"><center>
<h3>Usage</h3>
</center></a>

</p><p>There are options (taken by both perfect and the sanity test):
</p><pre>     perfect [-{NnIiHhDdAa}{MmPp}{FfSs}] &lt; key.txt 
</pre>

<p>Only one of NnIiHhAa may be specified.  N is the default.  These
say how to interpret the keys.  The input is always a list of keys,
one key per line.
</p><dl>
<dt>N,n
</dt><dd>Normal mode, key is any string string (default).  About 42+6n
instructions for an n-byte key, or a 119+7n instructions if there are
more than 2<sup>18</sup> keys.

</dd><dt>I,i
</dt><dd>Inline, key is any string, user will do initial hash.  The initial
hash must be
<pre>    hash = PHASHSALT;
    for (i=0; i&lt;keylength; ++i) {
      hash = (hash ^ key[i]) + ((hash&lt;&lt;26)+(hash&gt;&gt;6));
    }
</pre>
Note that this can be inlined in any user loop that walks through the
key anyways, eliminating the loop overhead.

</dd><dt>H,h
</dt><dd>Keys are 4-byte integers in hex in this format:
<pre>      ffffffff
</pre>
In the worst case for up to 8192 keys whose values are all less than
0x10000, the perfect hash is this:
<pre>      hash = key+CONSTANT;
      hash += (hash&gt;&gt;8);
      hash ^= (hash&lt;&lt;4);
      b = (hash &gt;&gt; j) &amp; 7;
      a = (hash + (hash &lt;&lt; k)) &gt;&gt; 29;
      return a^tab[b];
</pre>
...and it's usually faster than that.  Hashing 4 keys takes up to 8 
instructions, three take up to 4, two take up to 2, and for one the 
hash is always "return 0".

<p>Switch statements could be compiled as a perfect hash 
(<tt>perfect -hp &lt; hex.txt</tt>),
followed by a jump into a spring table by hash value, followed by a
test of the case (since non-case values could have the same hash as a
case value). That would be faster than the binary tree of branches
currently used by gcc and the Solaris compiler.

</p></dd><dt><a name="d">D,d</a>
</dt><dd>Decimal.  Same as H,h, but decimal instead of hexidecimal.  Did I
mention this is good for switch statement optimization?  For example,
the perfect hash for <tt>1,16,256</tt> is 
<tt>hash=((key+(key&gt;&gt;3))&amp;3);</tt> and the perfect hash for
<tt>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8</tt> is <tt>hash=(key&amp;7);</tt> and the perfect
hash for <tt>1,4,9,16,25,36,49</tt> is
<pre>  ub1 tab[] = {0,7,0,2,3,0,3,0};
  hash = key^tab[(key&lt;&lt;26)&gt;&gt;29];
</pre>

</dd><dt>A,a
</dt><dd>An (A,B) pair is supplied in hex in this format:
<pre>      aaaaaaaa bbbbbbbb
</pre>
This mode does nothing but find the values of <tt>tab[]</tt>.
If n is the number of keys and 2<sup>i</sup> &lt;= n &lt;=
2<sup>i+1</sup>, then <tt>A</tt> should be less than 2<sup>i</sup> if
the hash is minimal, otherwise less than 2<sup>i+1</sup>.  The hash is
<tt>A^tab[B]</tt>, or <tt>A^scramble[tab[B]]</tt> if there is a B
bigger than 2048.  The user must figure out how to generate (A,B).
Unlike the other modes, the generator cannot rechoose (A,B) if it has
problems, so the user must be prepared to deal with failure in this
mode.  Unlike other modes, this mode will attempt to increase smax.

<p>Parse tables for production rules, or any static sparse tables,
could be efficiently compacted using this option.  Make B the row
and A the column.  For parse tables, B would be the state and A would 
be the ID for the next token.  -ap is a good option.

</p></dd><dt>B,b
</dt><dd>Same as A,a, except in decimal not hexidecimal.
</dd></dl>


<p>Only one of MmPp may be specified.  M is the default.  These say
whether to do a minimal perfect hash or just a perfect hash.
</p><dl>
<dt>M,m
</dt><dd>Minimal perfect hash.  Hash values will be in 0..nkeys-1, and
every possible hash value will have a matching key.  This is the
default.  The size of tab[] will be 3..8 bits per key.
</dd><dt>P,p
</dt><dd>Perfect hash.  Hash values will be in 0..n-1, where n the smallest
power of 2 greater or equal to the number of keys.  The size of tab[]
will be 1..4 bits per key.
</dd></dl>

<p>Only one of FfSs may be specified.  S is the default.
</p><dl>
<dt>F,f
</dt><dd>Fast mode.  Don't construct the transitive closure.  Try to find
an initial hash within 10 tries, rather than within 2000 tries.
(Transitive closure is used anyways for minimal perfect hashes with
tab[] of size 2048 or bigger because you just can't succeed without
it.)  This will generate a perfect hash in linear time in the number
of keys.  It will result in tab[] being much bigger than it needs to be.

</dd><dt>S,s
</dt><dd>Slow mode.  Take more time generating the perfect hash in hopes of
making tab[] as small as possible.
</dd></dl>

<h3>Examples and Performance</h3>
</center></a>

<p>Timings were done on a 500mhz Pentium with 128meg RAM, and it's
actually the number of cursor blinks not seconds.  ispell.txt
is a list of English words that comes with EMACS.  mill.txt was a
million keys where each key was three random 4-byte numbers in hex.
tab[] is always an array of 1-byte values.  Normally I use a 166mhz
machine with 32meg RAM, but a million keys died thrashing virtual
memory on that.

<h3>Algorithm</h3>
</center></a>

<h4>Initial hash returns (A,B), final hash is A^tab[B]</h4>

<p>The perfect hash algorithm I use isn't a <a href="#pearson">Pearson
hash</a>.  My perfect hash algorithm uses an initial hash to find a
pair (A,B) for each keyword, then it generates a mapping table
<tt>tab[]</tt> so that <tt>A^tab[B]</tt> (or
<tt>A^scramble[tab[B]]</tt>) is unique for each
keyword. <tt>tab[]</tt> is always a power of two. When tab[] has 4096
or more entries, <tt>scramble[]</tt> is used and tab[] holds 1-byte
values.  <tt>scramble[]</tt> is always 256 values (2-byte or 4-byte
values depending on the size of hash values).

</p><p>I found the idea of generating (A,B) from the keys in
"Practical minimal perfect hash functions for large databases", Fox,
Heath, Chen, and Daoud, Communications of the ACM, January 1992.
(Dean Inada pointed me to that article shortly after I put code for a
Pearson-style hash on my site.)

</p><p>Any specific hash function may or may not produce a distinct (A,B)
for each key.  There is some probability of success.  If the hash
is good, the probability of success depends only on the size of the
ranges of A and B compared to the number of keys.  So the initial hash
for this algorithm actually must be a set of independent hash
functions ("universal hashing").  Different hashes are tried from the
set until one is found which produces distinct (A,B).  A probability
of success of .5 is easy to achieve, but smaller ranges for B (which
imply smaller probabilities of success) require a smaller tab[].

</p><p>The different input modes use different initial hashes.  Normal
mode uses my general hash <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/lookupa.c">lookup()</a> (42+6n
instructions) (or <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/lookupa.c">checksum()</a> if there are
more than 2<sup>18</sup> keys).  Inline mode requires the user to compute
the initial hash themself, preferably as part of tokenizing the key in
the first place (to eliminate the loop overhead and the cost of
fetching the characters in the key).  Hex mode, which takes
integer keys, does a brute force search to find how little mixing it
can get away with.  AB mode gets the (A,B) pairs from the user, giving
the user complete control over initial mixing.

</p><p>The final hash is always <tt>A^tab[B]</tt> or
<tt>A^scramble[tab[B]]</tt>.  <tt>scramble[]</tt> is initialized with
random distinct values up to <tt>smax</tt>, the smallest power of two
greater or equal to the number of keys.  The trick is to fill in
<tt>tab[]</tt>.  Multiple keys may share the same <tt>B</tt>, so share
the same tab[B].  The elements of tab[] are handled in descending
order by the number of keys.

</p><h4>Spanning Trees and Augmenting Paths</h4>

<p>Finding values for tab[] such that A^tab[B] causes no collisions is
known as the "sparse matrix compression problem", which is NP
complete.  ("Computers and Intractability, A Guide to the Theory of
NP-Completeness", Garey &amp; Johnson, 1979)  Like most NP complete
problems, there are fast heuristics for getting reasonable (but not
optimal) solutions.  The heuristic I use involves spanning trees.

</p><p>Spanning trees and augmenting paths (with elements of
<tt>tab[]</tt> as nodes) are used to choose values for tab[b] and to
rearrange existing values in tab[] to make room.  The element being
added is the root of the tree.

</p><p>Spanning trees imply a graph with nodes and edges, right?  The
nodes are the elements of tab[].  Each element has a list of keys
(tab[x] has all the keys with B=x), and needs to be assigned a value
(the value for tab[x] when A^tab[B] is computed).  Keys are added to
the perfect hash one element of tab[] at a time.  Each element may
contain many keys.  For each possible value of tab[x], we see what
that value causes the keys to collide with.  If the keys collide with
keys in only one other element, that defines an edge from the other
element pointing back to this element.  If the keys collide with
nothing, that's a leaf, and the augmenting path follows that leaf
along the nodes back to the root.

</p><p>If an augmenting path is found and all the nodes in it have one key
apiece, it is guaranteed the augmenting path can be applied.  Changing
the leaf makes room for its parent's key, and so forth, until room is made
for the one key being mapped.  (If the element to be mapped has only
one key, and there is no restriction on the values of tab[],
augmenting paths aren't needed.  A value for tab[B] can be chosen that
maps that key directly to an open hash value.)  

</p><p>If the augmenting path contains nodes with multiple keys, there is
no guarantee the agumenting path can be applied.  Moving the keys for
the leaf will make room for the keys of the parent that collided with
that leaf originally, but there is no guarantee that the other keys in
the leaf and the parent won't apply.  Empirically, this happens a
around once per ten minimal perfect hashes generated.  There must be code
to handle rolling back an augmenting path that runs into this, but
it's not worthwhile trying to avoid the problem.

</p><p>A possible strategy for finding a perfect hash is to accept the
first value tried for tab[x] that causes tab[x]'s keys to collide with
keys in zero other already-mapped elements in tab[].  ("Collide" means
this some key in this element has the same hash value as some key in
the other element.)  This strategy is called "first fit descending"
(recall that elements are tried in descending order of number of keys).

</p><p>A second, more sophisticated, strategy would allow the keys of
tab[x] to collide with zero or one other elements in tab[].  If it
collides with one other element, the problem changes to mapping that
one other element.  There is no upper bound on the running time of
this strategy.

</p><p>The use of spanning trees and augmenting paths is almost as
powerful as the second strategy, and it is guaranteed to terminate
within O(nn) time (per element mapped).  Is it faster or better on 
average?  I don't know.  I would guess it is.  Spanning trees can
ignore already-explored nodes, while the random jumping method
doesn't.

</p><p>How much do spanning trees help compared to first fit descending?
First consider the case where tab[] values can be anything.  Minimal
perfect hashes need tab[] 31% bigger and perfect hashes need tab[] 4%
bigger (on average) if multikey spanning trees aren't used.  Next the
case where tab[] values are one of 256 values.  Minimal perfect hashes
cannot be found at all, and perfect hashes need tab[] 15% bigger on
average.  

</p><p>It turns out that restricting the size of A in A^tab[B] is also a
good way to limit the size of tab[].

<p>Pointers to other implementations of perfect hashing

<li><a href="http://www.cco.caltech.edu/cco/texinfo/libgplusplus/gperf_3.html">
gperf</a> is a perfect hashing package available under the GNU
license.  The hash it generates is usually slightly faster than mine, 
but it can't handle anagrams (like if and fi, or tar and art), and it 
can't handle more than a couple hundred keys.
</li><li><a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/devel/lang/c/%21INDEX.short.html">
mph (Minimal Perfect Hash)</a> can do perfect hashes, minimal perfect
hashes, and order preserving minimal perfect hashes.  I haven't looked
into it much yet, but it's promising.  It's based on a paper by
Majewski, who is an expert in academia on the current state of the art
of perfect hashes.  Its doc starts out "I wrote this for fun...", so
download it and see what you can get it to do!  Perfect hashing IS fun.
</li><li>Gonnet/Baeza-Yates of Chile have a <a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/%7Eoalonso/handbook/hbook.html"> handbook on
the web</a> with a <a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/%7Eoalonso/handbook/algs/3/3316.ins.c.html">

</li></ol>

<a name="pearson"><h3>Minimal perfect hashing with Pearson hashes</h3></a>

<p>A minimal perfect Pearson hash looks like this:
</p><pre>  hash = 0;
  for (i=0; i&lt;len; ++i)
    hash = tab[(hash+key[i])%n];
</pre>
It is almost always faster than my perfect hash in -i mode, by 0..3
cycles per character (mostly depending on whether your machine has a
barrelshift instruction).

<p>A <i>minimal perfect hash</i> maps n keys to a range of n elements
with no collisions.   A <i>perfect hash</i> maps n keys to a range of
m elements, m&gt;=n, with no collisions.  If perfect hashing is
implemented as a special table for <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/pearson.html">Pearson's
hash</a> (the usual implementation), minimal perfect hashing is
not always possible, with probabilities given in the table below.  
For example the two binary strings {(0,1),(1,0)}
are not perfectly hashed by the table [0,1] or the table [1,0], and
those are all the choices available.  For sets of 8 or more elements,
the chances are negligible that no perfect hash exists, specifically
(1-n!/n<sup>n</sup>)<sup>n!</sup>.  Even if they do exist, finding one
may be an intractable problem.

<p>Although Pearson-style minimal perfect hashings do not always
exist, minimal perfect hashes always exist.  For example, the hash which
stores a sorted table of all keywords, and the location of each
keyword is its hash, is a minimal perfect hash of n keywords into
0..n-1.  This sorted-table minimal perfect hash might not even be
slower than Pearson perfect hashing, since the sorted-table hash must
do a comparison per bit of key, while the Pearson hash must do an
operation for every character of the key.
